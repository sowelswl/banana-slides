    * Optimized format example prompts, HTTP error message copy, Modal closing experience, cleaned up localStorage for old projects, and removed redundant prompts for first-time project creation.
    * Various other optimizations and fixes.

## ✨ Project Origin

Have you ever found yourself in this dilemma: the report is due tomorrow, but your PPT is still a blank slate; you have countless brilliant ideas in your head, but all your passion is drained by the tedious work of layout and design?

We long to quickly create presentations that are both professional and well-designed. While traditional AI PPT generation apps generally meet the need for "speed," they still suffer from the following issues:

- 1️⃣ Limited to preset templates with no flexibility to adjust styles
- 2️⃣ Low degree of freedom, making multi-round revisions difficult 
- 3️⃣ Highly homogenized results with a similar look and feel
- 4️⃣ Low-quality assets that lack specificity
- 5️⃣ Fragmented image-text layouts with a poor sense of design

These drawbacks make it difficult for traditional AI PPT generators to simultaneously satisfy our two core needs: "efficiency" and "aesthetics." Even those claiming to be "Vibe PPTs" are, in my eyes, far from being truly "Vibe."

However, the emergence of the nano banana 🍌 model has brought a turning point. I tried using 🍌pro to generate PPT pages and found that the results were excellent in terms of quality, aesthetics, and consistency. It can accurately render almost all the text requested in the prompts while strictly following the style of reference images. So, why not build a native "Vibe PPT" application based on 🍌pro?

## 👨‍💻 Use Cases

1. **Beginners**: Quickly generate beautiful PPTs with zero barrier to entry and no design experience required, eliminating the hassle of choosing templates.
2. **PPT Professionals**: Gain design inspiration quickly by referencing AI-generated layouts and combinations of visual and text elements.
3. **Educators**: Rapidly transform teaching content into illustrated lesson plan PPTs to enhance classroom effectiveness.
4. **Students**: Complete presentation assignments quickly, allowing focus on core content rather than layout and aesthetics.
5. **Workplace Professionals**: Quickly visualize business proposals and product introductions with fast adaptation across multiple scenarios.

<p>
  <b>🎯Goal: Lower the barrier to PPT creation, enabling everyone to quickly produce beautiful and professional presentations.</b>
</p>

  <summary>📒 Vertex AI Configuration Guide (For GCP Users)</summary>

Google Cloud Vertex AI allows calling Gemini models via GCP service accounts; new users can use promotional credits. Configuration steps:

1. Go to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a service account and download the JSON key file.
2. Save the key file as `gcp-service-account.json` in the project root directory.
3. Set in `.env`:
   ```env
   AI_PROVIDER_FORMAT=vertex
   VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
   VERTEX_LOCATION=global
   ```
4. If using Docker for deployment, you also need to uncomment relevant sections in `docker-compose.yml`, mount the key file into the container, and set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable.

> The `gemini-3-*` series models require `VERTEX_LOCATION=global`.

</details>

2. **Start Services**

**⚡ Use Pre-built Images (Recommended)**

The project provides pre-built frontend and backend images on Docker Hub (synced with the latest version of the main branch), allowing you to skip local build steps for rapid deployment:

```bash

# Start with Pre-built Images (No Need to Build from Scratch)

docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

Image names:
- `anoinex/banana-slides-frontend:latest`
- `anoinex/banana-slides-backend:latest`

**Build images from scratch**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```


> [!TIP]
> In case of network issues, you can uncomment the mirror source configurations in the `.env` file, then rerun the startup command:
> ```env
> # Uncomment the following in the .env file to use domestic mirror sources
> DOCKER_REGISTRY=docker.1ms.run/
> GHCR_REGISTRY=ghcr.nju.edu.cn/
> APT_MIRROR=mirrors.aliyun.com
> PYPI_INDEX_URL=https://mirrors.cloud.tencent.com/pypi/simple
> NPM_REGISTRY=https://registry.npmmirror.com/
> ```


3. **Accessing the Application**

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000

### Deploy from Source

#### Environment Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Python package manager
- Node.js 16+ and npm
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) - Required for narration video export, and must include `libass` / `ass` subtitle filter support
- A valid Google Gemini API key
- (Optional) [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - Required when using the "PPT Refurbishment" feature to upload PPTX files, used for converting PPTX to PDF. **It is recommended to convert PPTX to PDF locally before uploading.** Reason: Server-side rendering via LibreOffice may cause layout misalignment due to missing fonts (such as Microsoft YaHei, Calibri, etc.) and cannot fully restore certain special effects. LibreOffice is not required if uploading PDF files. For Docker users who still need PPTX upload support within the container, run:
  ```bash
  docker exec -it banana-slides-backend bash -c "apt-get update && apt-get install -y libreoffice-impress && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*"
  ```
  > Note: LibreOffice installed this way will be lost after the container is rebuilt and will need to be reinstalled.

#### Backend Installation

0. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Anionex/banana-slides
cd banana-slides
```

1. **Install uv (if not already installed)**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. **Install dependencies**

Run in the project root directory:
```bash

# macOS (Homebrew)

```markdown
brew install ffmpeg-full
brew unlink ffmpeg 2>/dev/null || true
brew link --overwrite --force ffmpeg-full
```

# Ubuntu / Debian

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg libass9
```

# Then install Python dependencies

uv sync
```

This will automatically install all dependencies based on `pyproject.toml`.

3. **Configure environment variables**

Copy the environment variable template:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

# Then, follow the previously mentioned method to open and edit the `.env` file and configure your API key

Please provide the Chinese Markdown content you would like me to translate. There is currently no content provided between the "Original content" and "Translated English version" sections.

#### Frontend Installation

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**
```bash
cd frontend
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Configure the API address**

The frontend will automatically connect to the backend service at `http://localhost:5000`. If you need to modify this, please edit `src/api/client.ts`.

#### Start Backend Service

> (Optional) If you have important local data, it is recommended to back up the database before upgrading:  
> `cp backend/instance/database.db backend/instance/database.db.bak`
> Note: Under the default configuration, templates, assets, and finished products are all stored in the `uploads/` folder.

```bash
cd backend
uv run alembic upgrade head && uv run python app.py
```

The backend service will start at `http://localhost:5000`.

Visit `http://localhost:5000/health` to verify that the service is running correctly.

#### Start the Front-end Development Server

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend development server will start at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open your browser to access and use the application.
